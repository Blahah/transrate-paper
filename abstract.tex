Improvements in short-read sequencing technology combined with rapidly decreasing prices have enabled the use of RNA-seq to assay the transcriptome of species whose genome has not been sequenced. {\it De-novo} transcriptome assembly attempts to reconstruct the original transcript sequences from short reads.

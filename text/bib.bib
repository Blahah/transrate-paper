	abstract = {Motivation: Transcriptome sequencing has long been the favored method for quickly and inexpensively obtaining a large number of gene sequences from an organism with no reference genome. Owing to the rapid increase in throughputs and decrease in costs of next- generation sequencing, {RNA}-Seq in particular has become the method of choice. However, the very short reads (e.g. 2 × 90 bp paired ends) from next generation sequencing makes de novo assembly to recover complete or full-length transcript sequences an algorithmic challenge.
Results: Here, we present {SOAPdenovo}-Trans, a de novo transcriptome assembler designed specifically for {RNA}-Seq. We evaluated its performance on transcriptome datasets from rice and mouse. Using as our benchmarks the known transcripts from these well-annotated genomes (sequenced a decade ago), we assessed how {SOAPdenovo}-Trans and two other popular transcriptome assemblers handled such practical issues as alternative splicing and variable expression levels. Our conclusion is that {SOAPdenovo}-Trans provides higher contiguity, lower redundancy and faster execution.

Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btt219},
	abstract = {Motivation: {RNA} sequencing based on next-generation sequencing technology is effective for analyzing transcriptomes. Like de novo genome assembly, de novo transcriptome assembly does not rely on any reference genome or additional annotation information, but is more difficult. In particular, isoforms can have very uneven expression levels (e.g. 1:100), which make it very difficult to identify low-expressed isoforms. One challenge is to remove erroneous vertices/edges with high multiplicity (produced by high-expressed isoforms) in the de Bruijn graph without removing correct ones with not-so-high multiplicity from low-expressed isoforms. Failing to do so will result in the loss of low-expressed isoforms or having complicated subgraphs with transcripts of different genes mixed together due to erroneous vertices/edges.
Contributions: Unlike existing tools, which remove erroneous vertices/edges with multiplicities lower than a global threshold, we use a probabilistic progressive approach to iteratively remove them with local thresholds. This enables us to decompose the graph into disconnected components, each containing a few genes, if not a single gene, while retaining many correct vertices/edges of low-expressed isoforms. Combined with existing techniques, {IDBA}-Tran is able to assemble both high-expressed and low-expressed transcripts and outperform existing assemblers in terms of sensitivity and specificity for both simulated and real data.

In the absence of a known genome, it is necessary to assemble these sequences de novo, taking into account possible alternative isoforms and the dynamic range of expression values.
Results: We present a software package named Oases designed to heuristically assemble {RNA}-seq reads in the absence of a reference genome, across a broad spectrum of expression values and in presence of alternative isoforms. It achieves this by using an array of hash lengths, a dynamic filtering of noise, a robust resolution of alternative splicing events and the efficient merging of multiple assemblies. It was tested on human and mouse {RNA}-seq data and is shown to improve significantly on the {transABySS} and Trinity de novo transcriptome assemblers.

From a computational perspective, repeats create ambiguities in alignment and assembly, which, in turn, can produce biases and errors when interpreting results. Simply ignoring repeats is not an option, as this creates problems of its own and may mean that important biological phenomena are missed.

The emergence of deep sequencing of trancriptome, known as {RNAseq}, has opened many opportunities for the identification of this class of genomic alterations, leading to the discovery of novel chimeric transcripts in melanomas, breast cancers and lymphomas. Nowadays, few computational approaches have been developed for the detection of chimeric transcripts. Although all of these computational methods show good sensitivity, much work remains to reduce the huge number of false positive calls that arises from this analysis.
Results: We proposed a novel computational framework, named {chimEric} {tranScript} detection algorithm ({EricScript}), for the identification of gene fusion products in paired-end {RNA}-seq data. Our simulation study on synthetic data demonstrates that {EricScript} enables to achieve higher sensitivity and specificity than existing methods with noticeably lower running times. We also applied our method to publicly available {RNA}-seq tumour datasets and we showed its capability in rediscovering known gene fusions.

	abstract = {We present the Scalable Nucleotide Alignment Program ({SNAP}), a new short and long read aligner that is both more accurate (i.e., aligns more reads with fewer errors) and 10-100x faster than state-of-the-art tools such as {BWA}. Unlike recent aligners based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform, {SNAP} uses a simple hash index of short seed sequences from the genome, similar to {BLAST}'s. However, {SNAP} greatly reduces the number and cost of local alignment checks performed through several measures: it uses longer seeds to reduce the false positive locations considered, leverages larger memory capacities to speed index lookup, and excludes most candidate locations without fully computing their edit distance to the read. The result is an algorithm that scales well for reads from one hundred to thousands of bases long and provides a rich error model that can match classes of mutations (e.g., longer indels) that today's fast aligners ignore. We calculate that {SNAP} can align a dataset with 30x coverage of a human genome in less than an hour for a cost of \$2 on Amazon {EC}2, with higher accuracy than {BWA}. Finally, we describe ongoing work to further improve {SNAP}.},

	abstract = {Next generation sequencing has made it possible to perform differential gene expression studies in non-model organisms. For these studies, the need for a reference genome is circumvented by performing de novo assembly on the {RNA}-seq data. However, transcriptome assembly produces a multitude of contigs, which must be clustered into genes prior to differential gene expression detection. Here we present Corset, a method that hierarchically clusters contigs using shared reads and expression, then summarizes read counts to clusters, ready for statistical testing. Using a range of metrics, we demonstrate that Corset out-performs alternative methods. Corset is available from https://code.google.com/p/corset-project/.

	abstract = {Background
Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool ({BLAST}) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current {BLAST} software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications.

Results
We describe features and improvements of rewritten {BLAST} software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing {CPU} time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the {BLAST} databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the {NCBI} {BLAST} web site.

Conclusion
The new {BLAST} command-line applications, compared to the current {BLAST} tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Researchers need general purpose methods for objectively evaluating the accuracy of single and metagenome assemblies and for automatically detecting any errors they may contain. Current methods do not fully meet this need because they require a reference, only consider one of the many aspects of assembly quality or lack statistical justification, and none are designed to evaluate metagenome assemblies.
Results: In this article, we present an Assembly Likelihood Evaluation ({ALE}) framework that overcomes these limitations, systematically evaluating the accuracy of an assembly in a reference-independent manner using rigorous statistical methods. This framework is comprehensive, and integrates read quality, mate pair orientation and insert length (for paired-end reads), sequencing coverage, read alignment and k-mer frequency. {ALE} pinpoints synthetic errors in both single and metagenomic assemblies, including single-base errors, insertions/deletions, genome rearrangements and chimeric assemblies presented in metagenomes. At the genome level with real-world data, {ALE} identifies three large misassemblies from the Spirochaeta smaragdinae finished genome, which were all independently validated by Pacific Biosciences sequencing. At the single-base level with Illumina data, {ALE} recovers 215 of 222 (97\%) single nucleotide variants in a training set from a {GC}-rich Rhodobacter sphaeroides genome. Using real Pacific Biosciences data, {ALE} identifies 12 of 12 synthetic errors in a Lambda Phage genome, surpassing even Pacific Biosciences’ own variant caller, {EviCons}. In summary, the {ALE} framework provides a comprehensive, reference-independent and statistically rigorous measure of single genome and metagenome assembly accuracy, which can be used to identify misassemblies or to optimize the assembly process.

Nature, impact and mutual interference of biases in different experimental setups are, however, still poorly understood—mostly due to the lack of data from intermediate protocol steps. We analysed multiple {RNA}-Seq experiments, involving different sample preparation protocols and sequencing platforms: we broke them down into their common—and currently indispensable—technical components (reverse transcription, fragmentation, adapter ligation, {PCR} amplification, gel segregation and sequencing), investigating how such different steps influence abundance and distribution of the sequenced reads. For each of those steps, we developed universally applicable models, which can be parameterised by empirical attributes of any experimental protocol. Our models are implemented in a computer simulation pipeline called the Flux Simulator, and we show that read distributions generated by different combinations of these models reproduce well corresponding evidence obtained from the corresponding experimental setups. We further demonstrate that our in silico {RNA}-Seq provides insights about hidden precursors that determine the final configuration of reads along gene bodies; enhancing or compensatory effects that explain apparently controversial observations can be observed. Moreover, our simulations identify hitherto unreported sources of systematic bias from {RNA} hydrolysis, a fragmentation technique currently employed by most {RNA}-Seq protocols.},

On the other hand, humans and other mammals possess a very limited ability to regenerate limb structures. Learning about the genes, gene networks, and pathways activated in the salamander during limb regeneration will provide cues to improving the regenerative response in mammals. Elucidating these genes, networks, and pathways is difficult, however, because the axolotl does not yet have its genome sequenced and because it has diverged evolutionarily from species with a sequenced genome. Here, we produce a set of gene transcripts via {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) for the axolotl and provide information on the nature of the genes activated during regeneration. To determine the identity of these axolotl genes, we use comparative transcriptomics techniques to match the axolotl transcript data to that of the well-annotated human gene set. Supporting previous studies, we find upregulation of many genes previously found to be involved in limb development and regeneration. In addition, we find a burst of cancer-related genes during the first phase of regeneration and identify a set of genes previously not associated with the regeneration process.},

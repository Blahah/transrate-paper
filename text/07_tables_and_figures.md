Flow diagram explaining that reads are mapped to reference etc.

### Figure 2

Existing commonly used metrics used on the tests datasets used in this paper to describe the datasets.

### Figure 3

A) Plot of distribution of values per contig of all selected scores.
B) Correlation between all scores.
C) still to be decided.

### Figure 4

Distribution of all contig scores for each of the species for each of the assemblies. Small plots two column figure.

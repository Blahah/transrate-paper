# Meeting SK JMH CMB skype

### blat reference against genome is failing

- inspect the alignments that failed
- see if there's something obvious about them
- compare the intron size distributions between the populations - does this explain it?

### alternative plots

- plot the contig score against blat fake score
- plot the actual score on the x-axis with proportion true on the y-axis
- plot the contig score against blat actual score
- plot the contig score aganist blaast log10-bitscore

### alternative y-axis

- proportion of things that align that are perfectly aligned
-

### alternative aligners

- SIM4
- GMAP - https://www.msi.umn.edu/sw/gmap---genomic-m
